# Password-Cracker


Creating a password cracker tool involves various approaches and techniques, typically based on dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, or other sophisticated methods. For educational purposes and within legal and ethical boundaries, here's a basic example of a dictionary attack-based password cracker in Python.

Please note: Using this tool against systems without permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have authorization to test or use such tools.

This example assumes you have a text file with a list of common passwords to be used as a dictionary for the attack.

It uses a dictionary-based approach where it hashes each password in the provided dictionary file and compares it against a given hashed password. If a match is found, it prints the cracked password.

It  uses a simplistic hashing method (SHA-256) for demonstration purposes. In real scenarios, passwords might be hashed using more secure algorithms and techniques. Additionally, password cracking often involves more advanced strategies, including rules-based attacks, rainbow tables, or custom wordlists.

Always remember to use such tools responsibly and legally. Unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data is illegal and unethical.
